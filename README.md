# TechniSat Isio S1 - Hardware & Software Internals

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

This repository is a community-driven effort to document the hardware components, boot process, and software internals of the TechniSat Isio S1 satellite receiver. Our goal is to understand the device better, enable potential repairs, and explore possibilities for running custom or alternative software.

## Hardware Overview & Documentation

A detailed breakdown of all identified hardware components, including the SoC, memory, flash chips, and more, can be found on our project Wiki. The Wiki is the central place for all technical documentation.
